# Hatch Cover Rebuild

## Problem

The current OEM vent/hatch cover for Gary Bussy suffers from deformations that cause leaking around the edges despite liberal use of a heat gun and a new foam seal. It also traps water in the top which sometimes will find a way through the hatch itself due to it originally having a ventilation system built in. I have tried to compensate with sealants, but it needs to be replaced. The entry shroud is in ok condition and the interface to the roof was redone in summer of 2021 with generous use of butyl and new hardware, it does not seem to be a source of leaks.

## Solution

### **Summary**

In researching existing bus hatches I have found than many modern solutions rely on a more complex solution to perform the two stages of venting and exit hatch. This solution uses spring tension on multiple points to create a more even distribution of force across the seal of the cover that interfaces with the shroud. It also allows for a full 360Â° opening when in vent mode compared to only being fully open on one side with 2 sides being half open and the last side being fully closed. While its current solution of angling the cover may work well to direct air into the cabin while driving, it is no longer a school bus that carries passengers, so the feature is moot.

### **Material**

Polycarbonate sheeting may be the best option for durability. Tap Plastics currently offers PC in a "solar gray" with UV protective properties for $71.80 for a 24x24" sheet at 1/4" thickness (larger than necessary). Machining or lasering PC for final use is relatively simple tho I currently only have access to a Glowforge which would require careful multistage setups to complete what is wanted. It's also possible to obtain positive results from basic hand and power tools. Access to a band saw may be useful for radius corners.

The "solar gray" color would allow for the hatch to also be a skylight for additional natural light ingress. A shade may have to be fabricated for certain situations.

### **Mechanical**

Two options exist to create the mechanical portion of the hatch and they both rely on spring or gas tension. My go to would be to use short gas shocks in a configuration in which they both force towards each other into a bracket attached to the cover, the other side attached to the sidewall of the entry shroud. Two of these systems would oppose each other, 4 gas struts into two brackets.

Speaking of a single side with both systems working in tandem, the mounts for the struts would provide a rotational axis, allowing the bracket to move up and down. The system's natural tendency would be to extend fully vertical, the gas struts being at an angle that mirrors each other once fully extended.

When pulling the bracket down, the struts should be far enough apart from each other to allow the bracket to pass between them when fully horizontal. The bracket would continue past this horizontal point now allowing the struts to create downward force. With the cover larger than the opening, it would stop the struts, bracket and itself from moving... keeping it in a closed position until forced upwards.

To exit, the cover would have to be in its vent position. One of the brackets would have a release latch or mechanism while the opposite would have a hinge.

### **Alternate Mechanical**

The alternate method would be very similar to the gas struts but the force would come from a spring instead of the struts.

The struts would be replaced with stiff bars that could rotate in a single plane on their mount points. Inside the bracket would be a spring connected to piston like objects on either side that directly connect to the bars. This theoretically could be mostly 3D printed, but would require more sourcing and potentially more machining of non 3D printed parts.

It may also end up being more durable and considering the existing mounting systems for gas struts aren't locked to a single plane, may be a better option for rigidity through travel.
