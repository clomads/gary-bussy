# Gary Bussy
Gary Bussy is the name of a 'skoolie' build whose chassis is based on a 1995 Chevy G30 with a 6.5L Detroit Diesel (NA). This repository is a place to keep documentation on various parts of the build process.

## Electrical

Electrical has evolved from a 300w of solar with 500whr of reclaimed 18650 lithium cells to what it is today. As I move to upgrade from around 850w of solar to 1450w of solar, I decided it time to map out the electrical system so I have a better high level overview of what's happening. The following drawio SVG will update as I make changes and is fully editable with any instance of [draw.io](https://draw.io)/[diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net)
