# Gary Bussy
Gary Bussy is the name of a 'skoolie' build whose chassis is based on a 1995 Chevy G30 with a 6.5L Detroit Diesel (NA). This repository is a place to keep documentation on various parts of the build process.

## Electrical

Electrical has evolved from a 300w of solar with 500whr of reclaimed 18650 lithium cells to what it is today. As I move from 850w of solar to 1450w of solar, I figured it time to map out the electrical system so I have a better high level overview of what's happening. 

The following drawio SVG will update as I make changes and is fully editable with any instance of [draw.io](https://draw.io)/[diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net)

## Notable Changes


### 20221122 
- Create repo with beginnings of electrical diagram
- Good test for using GitHub as save space with draw.io/diagrams.net
    - saves are direct comits to master - might want to change? At least I'll have history, not super important for this repo, but may be an issue for others.
- Upgrading solar while making this 
    - remove 2x 100w panels add 2x 400w panels
