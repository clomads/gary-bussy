# Plumbing

To date, plumbing has been pretty simple since Chloe lived in Van Morrison and then Gary Bussy - This may be a place to design and store future plans and may not be tested.

# History
- Van Morrison `Spring 2019`
  - Water jugs with spigots were a pain in the ass to lift for use and then you'd forget them on the shelf and drive and then they'd break (esp the clear plastic ones - very brittle)
  - Discovered USB water pump and ordered extra silicone tubing to store water in the back and feed it to the front (pump was quite impressive with this)
    - Water storage in Igloo brand 6 Gallon blue jug
    - USB Pump can be raised with 3/4" copper pipe or equivalent.
- Gary Bussy `Summer 2020`
  - Moved what was in Van Morrison to Gary Bussy.
  - Jug stored under cabinet - second jug obtained for swapping & longer storage.
- Gary Bussy `Winter 2022`
  - Using more water, need faster dispensing - ordered 12v pump, plumbing, & faucet to replace USB pump and silicone hose.
  - Will eventually get tanks to mount to replace igloo jugs
  - Have backup collapsible jugs (2x 5 gal) as backup and also for future gravity fill for aforementioned tank
