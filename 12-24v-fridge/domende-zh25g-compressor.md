# Domende - ZH25G Compressor

## **Controller**

BLDCM is used for this compressor, please check the wiring diagram as below and connect the compressors correctly. :

1\) Controller must be connected with DC power terminal ①. Reversed connection will result in off work.2) To protect the controller, fuse protector ② must be connected at positive pole terminal. And it should be nearthe power supply as possible as you can. We recommend to use 15A fuse (12V DC) or 7.5A fuse (24V DC).3) If you add a main power switch ③, the rated current should not be less than 20A.4) Do not add any other circuit to avoid controller protect duo to overload voltage.5) Add a 10mA luminous diode between “+”and D. The error during compressor operation will be indicated bythe flicker times, every flicker will last 1/4 second, each error will repeat every 4 seconds. If failed to start,another start will be tried after 60 seconds, till starts successfully. Please see below for reference:

6\) Cooling fan is connected between F+ and F-. 12V DC cooling fan must be used for both 12V DC coolingsystem and 24V DC cooling system because the voltage between F+ and F- is permanent 12V DC. Thecurrent protection is 1A, we suggest use cooling fan of smaller than 5W.7) Temperature control ⑥ is connected between C and T, it will control the compressor to start or stop.8) Resistance for speed adjustment ⑦ is connected between C and T. The compressor rotary speed can bechanged by adjusting the resistance value. The rotary speed can be adjusted at the range of 2000rpm～3500rpm. Resistance ⑦ and the rotary speed is corresponding as below:9) Power supply protection resistance ⑧ is connected between C and P. Different resistance value will changethe protection set of the battery voltage. The protection set of the battery voltage is corresponding with theresistance ⑧ as below.

10\) Compressor controller can adjust to suitable voltage automatically, when voltage is lower than 17V,controller regards it working in 12V DC cooling system; when voltage is higher than 17V, the controllerregards it working in 24V DC cooling system. If you add a 220KΩ resistance between C and T, then thecompressor can work at the voltage of 9.6V～31.5V.

**Instruction of transportation and storage**1） Keep vertical during transportation, do not reverse, avoiding big shake and shock.2） Store the compressor in the place of dry and good ventilation, avoid damped.3） 2 layer piled up is the limit for the carton packed compressor, turn over is forbidden during transportation.4） Stock date should not be longer than 6 month since come out from factory.

**Announcements**1） Compressor must be driven by the compressor controller, work voltage is 12V/24V, do not allow toconnect AC power directly.2） Install the compressor promptly after the rubber plug is removed.3） The working ambient temperature should not be higher than 43℃, when working in the Max. ambienttemperature, the Max. condensing pressure should not be higher than 1.75MPa, the Max. peak condensingpressure should not be higher than 2.17MPa.4） Pressure balance（43℃）When starting, there should not be pressure of 0.5MPa or above inside thecompressor body.5） The next start should be delayed 5 minutes or above after the compressor stops.6） Do not use compressor for vacuum purpose, do not power the compressor in vacuum condition.7） Keep the cooling system clean, avoid chlorine ion, paraffins, etc.8） To start and o
